# Customer-Segmentation-for-Targeted-Marketing-using-unsupervised-techniques


Leveraging a transnational dataset capturing transactions from 01/12/2010 to 09/12/2011 for a UK-based online retail company specializing in unique gifts, this project aims to identify distinct customer segments based on recency, frequency, and monetary value metrics. These segments enable precise marketing strategies, allowing the company to tailor its efforts to different customer groups effectively. By categorizing customers strategically, the company can optimize its marketing initiatives, enhance customer engagement, and ultimately drive sales growth and customer retention.
